# Single-page chat with Tinode

Example using Tinode to build a single-page chat application. The app uses
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), Google's [material design fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/)
and [icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web). The [Tinode javascript library](https://github.com/tinode/tinode-js/) has no
external dependencies.

This is work in progress. Bugs are expected. The work was tested in the latest Chrome & Firefox only.
