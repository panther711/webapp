# Single-page chat app to show Tinode functionality

License: Apache 2.0

Example using Tinode to build a single-page chat application. The app uses bootstrap, jquery (bootstrap dependency to make it dynamic), react.js.

This is work in progress. So far it's just a JS + HTML shell not hooked up to a server.

Try it at http://api.tinode.co/x/example-react-js/
