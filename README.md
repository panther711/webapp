# Single-page chat with Tinode

Single-page web chat application built with [Tinode](https://github.com/tinode/chat/). The app uses
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), Google's material design [fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/)
and [icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web). The [Tinode javascript SDK](https://github.com/tinode/tinode-js/) has no external dependencies.
Overall it's a lot like open source WhatsApp or Telegram web apps.

The app is about 200KB minified and gzipped. That includes all dependencies (React, ReactDOM), fonts, graphics, css etc.

Although the app is generally usable, keep in mind that this is work in progress. Some bugs probably exist. The app was tested in the latest Chrome & Firefox only. NPM package is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinode-webapp.

Try possibly newer or older version live at https://api.tinode.co/. For passwords for demo accounts and other instructions [see here](https://github.com/tinode/chat/#demo).

## Getting support

* Read [client-side](http://tinode.github.io/js-api/) and [server-side](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/docs/API.md) API documentation.
* For support, general questions, discussions post to [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tinode](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tinode).
* For bugs and feature requests [open an issue](https://github.com/tinode/webchat/issues/new).

## Internationalization

The app is fully internationalized using [React-Intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl). The UI language is selected automatically from the language specified by the browser. A specific language can be forced by adding `hl=XX` parameter to the URL, i.e. https://api.tinode.co/#?hl=ru.

As of the time of this writing there are only two translations. More translations are welcome. Send a pull request with a json file with translated strings. Take a look at [English](/src/i18n/en.json) and [Russian](/src/i18n/ru.json) translations for guidance.


## Missing functionality

* Previews not generated for videos, audio, links or docs.
* No end-to-end encryption.
* Emoji support is weak.
